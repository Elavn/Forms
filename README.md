This is a sample project demonstrating how to create a user signup form in a React Native mobile application using TypeScript. The form includes fields for name, password, confirm password, and phone number. Validation is implemented using React Hook Form and Yup to ensure the inputs meet specific requirements, like email format and password matching.

Features
Form Validation: Validates required fields, password strength, and ensures passwords match.
